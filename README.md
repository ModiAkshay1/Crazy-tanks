# Crazy-tanks

Overview

This project involves creating a 1 vs 1 tank battle game using the LibGDX framework, inspired by the Tank Stars game. The game features hilly terrain where two players take turns firing at each other until one tank is destroyed. The players can choose from multiple tanks, adjust the power and angle of their shots, and collect weapon upgrades. The game includes saving and loading game states and uses object-oriented principles and design patterns
